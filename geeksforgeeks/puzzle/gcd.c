Basic Euclidean Algorithm for GCD
The algorithm is based on below facts.

If we subtract smaller number from larger (we reduce larger number), GCD doesnâ€™t change.
 So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
Now instead of subtraction, if we divide smaller number, the algorithm stops when we 
find remainder 0.
